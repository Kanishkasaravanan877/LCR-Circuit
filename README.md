🔧 Components in the Circuit
• Inductor (L): Emulates magnetic energy retention during AC flow.
• Capacitor (C): Holds and releases electric charge via an electric field.
• Resistor (R): Opposes current flow and disperses energy as thermal loss.
• AC Voltage Supply: Injects oscillating energy into the system.
• Ground & Wiring: Ensures circuit continuity and a stable reference.

📘 Concepts You’ll Explore
• Resonance Frequency: The ideal condition where L and C effects balance, allowing maximum current.
• Impedance: The total effective resistance to AC, varying by frequency.
• Phase Angle: The difference in timing between voltage and current waveforms.
• Energy Oscillation: Watch how energy toggles between inductor and capacitor during cycles.

🎯 What You’ll Learn
✅ How the circuit responds across different AC frequencies
✅ Identifying resonance points and understanding their effects
✅ Concepts of damping, reactance, and quality factor (Q)
✅ The importance of voltage-current alignment in AC systems

🧰 Simulation Hints
• Vary frequency to locate the resonance peak.
• Track voltage levels on L, C, and R during the simulation.
• Use visual tools like the oscilloscope to study waveform timing and phase shifts.
